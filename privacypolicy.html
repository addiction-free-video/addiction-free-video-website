                data about the behavior of visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service collects
                data on which website a data subject has come to a website from (so-called referrers), which subpages of
                the website were accessed or how often and for which period of time a subpage was viewed. A web analysis
                is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
